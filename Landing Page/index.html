    <h1> HI, I am Anam</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I am an artist who is deeply passionate about the art of drawing. With an unwavering love for capturing moments and expressing emotions through my artwork, I have dedicated myself to the craft of drawing and the mesmerizing world of visual storytelling.
      From a young age, I discovered the power of the pencil and the canvas as my tools for self-expression. Drawing became a language through which I could communicate my thoughts, feelings, and observations with the world around me. It ignited a fire within me that continues to burn brightly to this day.
         Portraits hold a special place in my heart. I am endlessly fascinated by the human form and the intricacies of the faceâ€”the way a slight curve or a shadow can convey volumes about a person's story. Through my portraits, I strive to capture not just physical features but the essence of the individuals I depict, unveiling their unique journeys and emotions.
